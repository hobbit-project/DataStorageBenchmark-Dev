# Titan graph database implementation by HP Labs
## About
This implementation contains:

1. An importer for LDBC data from csv format to a [titan 0.5.X](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan) graph database using [IdGraph](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Id-Implementation) and [BatchGraph](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Batch-Implementation).
2. JVM style [blueprints gremlin](http://gremlindocs.com/) queries.

## Usage
* The implementation depends upon the ldbc driver. You should build and package it as a jar  and install it to your local maven repo with the following coordinates:
```
     <groupId>com.ldbc.driver</groupId>
     <artifactId>jeeves</artifactId>
     <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
```

* A control panel application is in the works to allow easy running of the importer and driver. Exmaple for importer:
```
     java -Dlogback.configurationFile=./logback.xml -jar liveGraphCP.jar cli -L ./db.conf /local/ldbcData/
```
###Arguments:
1. Path to a logback file controlling the logging level. (e.g. ./logback.xml)
2. Path to the jar file generated by the previous stage. (e.g. liveGraphCP.jar
3. Switches between command line interface (cli) and console (console - TBD) -L for load -R for run (not working yet)
4. path to directory with generated data (for -L argument)
